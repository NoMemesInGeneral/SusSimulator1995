## Work in Progress

We are still working on this shit, besides, its with a 90's astetic.

View the to do list at https://github.com/orgs/NoMemesInGeneral/projects/1.

# Have you ever wanted to experince the 90's homebrew scene from the eyes of a child who time traveled from 2021?

THen SusSimulator is for you!

With every shitty idiotic command you ever need, like Flame, and a half-assed gif command!

Now with Discord Interaction buttons for maximum Enjoyment!*

* Coming soon to every command or what ever

# It's OPEN SOURCE!

Yes kiddos Galexion was forced to change the embed messages to embed objects and backstabbed no one by making it open source go ahead try running the code its better then original developer who just copyed and pasted all the commands and did not even attemot to make a funtional bot
Now that i understand(i dont) the code, i can continue the legacy of sussimulator. Though its not perfect(and never will be) you can fuck around as much as your little heart desires. And you know what? we dont even care! the bot is armed with funny buttons, gifs(really bad ones), and is really abd at math(sounds like me).
